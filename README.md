This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

Copy and paste the below link into the browser.

	https://github.com/G00362383/DataRep-Querying_Project
  
Click the green, Clone or download drop down button and select Download ZIP.

When the ZIP is downloaded, right click the folder and select Extract all. 
Select the location that you want to store the ZIP contents.
Click into the folder, then click into the tab showing where your file is stored and tpye in cmd and hit enter.

The next step is to install all the required dependencies. This is <b>very important</b> step because if all the dependencies are not installed then the application will not work. All the needed dependencies are in the package.json file within the application under dependencies.

	npm install
	
If you want to view the application code in Visual Studio then enter the following:

	code .
	
To Run the app in the development mode enter the below command.

	npm start
	
The browser should automatically open the appliaction but if it does not, go to your browser and enter the following URL to view it in the browser.
	
	http://localhost:3000

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
