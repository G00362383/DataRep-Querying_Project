          <h3><b>BMW Automobiles</b></h3>
          <p>Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, commonly known as Bavarian Motor Works, BMW or BMW AG, is a German automobile,
            motorcycle and engine manufacturing company founded in 1916.</p>
          <p>BMW is headquartered in Munich, Bavaria. It also owns and produces Mini cars,
            and is the parent company of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. BMW produces motorcycles under BMW Motorrad.
            In 2012, the BMW Group produced 1,845,186 automobiles and 117,109 motorcycles across all of its brands.
            BMW is part of the “German Big 3” luxury automakers, along with Audi and Mercedes-Benz,
            which are the three best-selling luxury automakers in the world.</p>

          <h3><b>History</b></h3>
          <p>BMW was established as a business entity following a restructuring of the Rapp Motorenwerke
            aircraft manufacturing firm in 1917. After the end of World War I in 1918, BMW was forced to cease
            aircraft-engine production by the terms of the Versailles Armistice Treaty.
            The company consequently shifted to motorcycle production in 1923, once the restrictions
            of the treaty started to be lifted, followed by automobiles in 1928–29.</p>
          <p>The first car which BMW successfully produced and the car which launched BMW on the road to
            automobile production was the Dixi, it was based on the Austin 7 and licensed from the
            Austin Motor Company in Birmingham, England.</p>
          <p>BMW’s first significant aircraft engine (and commercial product of any sort) was the BMW IIIa
            inline-six liquid-cooled engine of 1918, much preferred for its high-altitude performance. With
            German rearmament in the 1930s, the company again began producing aircraft engines for the Luftwaffe.
            Among its successful World War II engine designs were the BMW 132 and BMW 801 air-cooled radial
            engines, and the pioneering BMW 003 axial-flow turbojet, which powered the tiny, 1944–1945–era
            jet-powered “emergency fighter”, the Heinkel He 162 Spatz.</p>

          <h3><b>1958</b></h3>
          <p>By the year 1958, the automotive division of BMW was in financial difficulties and a shareholders
            meeting was held to decide whether to go into liquidation or find a way of carrying on. It was
            decided to carry on and to try to cash in on the current economy car boom enjoyed so successfully
            by some of Germany’s ex-aircraft manufacturers such as Messerschmitt and Heinkel. The rights to
            manufacture the Italian Iso Isetta were bought; the tiny cars themselves were to be powered by a
            modified form of BMW’s own motorcycle engine. This was moderately successful and helped the company
            get back on its feet. The controlling majority shareholder of the BMW Aktiengesellschaft since 1959
            is the Quandt family, which owns about 46% of the stock. The rest is in public float.</p>

          <h3><b>1966</b></h3>
          <p>BMW acquired the Hans Glas company based in Dingolfing, Germany, in 1966. Glas vehicles were briefly
            badged as BMW until the company was fully absorbed. It was reputed that the acquisition was mainly to
            gain access to Glas’ development of the timing belt with an overhead camshaft in automotive applications,
            although some saw Glas’ Dingolfing plant as another incentive. However, this factory was outmoded and
            BMW’s biggest immediate gain was, according to themselves, a stock of highly qualified engineers and
            other personnel. The Glas factories continued to build a limited number of their existing models, while
            adding the manufacture of BMW front and rear axles until they could be closer incorporated into BMW.</p>

          <h3><b>1992</b></h3>
          <p>In 1992, BMW acquired a large stake in California based industrial design studio DesignworksUSA, which
            they fully acquired in 1995. In 1994, BMW bought the British Rover Group[19] (which at the time consisted
            of the Rover, Land Rover and MG brands as well as the rights to defunct brands including Austin and Morris),
            and owned it for six years. By 2000, Rover was incurring huge losses and BMW decided to sell the combine.
            The MG and Rover brands were sold to the Phoenix Consortium to form MG Rover, while Land Rover was taken
            over by Ford. BMW, meanwhile, retained the rights to build the new Mini, which was launched in 2001.</p>

          <h3><b>2009</b></h3>
          <p>Chief designer Chris Bangle announced his departure from BMW in February 2009, after serving on the design
            team for nearly seventeen years. He was replaced by Adrian van Hooydonk, Bangle’s former right-hand man.
            Bangle was known for his radical designs such as the 2002 7-Series and the 2002 Z4. In July 2007, the production
            rights for Husqvarna Motorcycles was purchased by BMW for a reported 93 million euros. BMW Motorrad plans to
            continue operating Husqvarna Motorcycles as a separate enterprise. All development, sales and production
            activities, as well as the current workforce, have remained in place at its present location at Varese.</p>

          <h3><b>2017</b></h3>
          <p>In June 2017, BMW was listed as the #1 most reputable company in the world by Forbes.com. Rankings are based
            upon aspects such as “people’s willingness to buy, recommend, work for, and invest in a company is driven 60%
            by their perceptions of the company and only 40% by their perceptions of their products.”</p>
